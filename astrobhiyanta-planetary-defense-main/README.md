## 📌 Problem Statement

NASA tracks over **30,000+ Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**, but the data is scattered and complex.  
There is no single, easy-to-use platform for:
- Visualizing asteroid impacts
- Understanding damage severity
- Testing mitigation strategies

---

## 💡 Solution

**Meteor Madness** is an interactive web-based tool that allows users to simulate asteroid impacts and analyze mitigation strategies using visual and data-driven models.

---

- 🌍 **3D Impact Simulation**
  - Blast radius
  - Shockwaves
  - Tsunami effects

- 🛡 **Mitigation Strategy Testing**
  - Kinetic impactor
  - Nuclear deflection
  - Gravity tractor
  - Evacuation planning

- 📊 **Data Visualization Dashboard**
  - Risk level charts
  - Impact probability
